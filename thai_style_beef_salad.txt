Thai Style Beef Salad
=====================

+ 1.25 lbs flank steak , trimmed of excess fat
+ Salt and ground black pepper
+ 1 tsp peanut or vegetable oil
+ 1/4 cup fish sauce
+ 1/4 cup juice from 3 limes
+ 4 tsp brown sugar
+ 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
+ 1/2 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, and sliced thin
+ 1/2 small red onion , sliced thin
+ 2 tblsp packed fresh cilantro leaves , torn
+ 2 tblsp packed fresh mint leaves , torn
+ 1 head Bibb or Boston lettuce , washed, dried, and torn into pieces (4 cups lightly packed)
+ 1/4 cup unsalted dry-roasted peanuts , chopped coarse

Directions
----------
1. Pat the steak dry with paper towels, then season generously with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add the steak and cook until well browned on both sides, about 10 minutes, reducing the heat to medium if the pan begins to scorch or smoke. Transfer the steak to a plate and let rest for 10 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, whisk the fish sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, and pepper flakes together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Pour half of the dressing into a large bowl and set aside.

1. Slice the steak crosswise on the bias into -inch-thick slices. Cut the longer slices in half, into roughly 3-inch lengths. Add the steak to the small bowl of dressing, toss to coat, and let marinate for 5 minutes.

1. Remove the steak from the dressing and discard the marinade. Toss the steak, cucumber, onion, cilantro, and mint with the reserved dressing in the large bowl. Arrange the lettuce on a large serving platter or individual plates. Spoon the steak and vegetables over the lettuce. Drizzle the salad with any dressing left in the bowl and sprinkle with the peanuts before serving.
