McKenna's Recipes
=================

I've been reading cooking magazines for years, and haven't found one that publishes recipes in my sweet spot. I love the delicious food in [Cooks Illustrated](http://www.cooksillustrated.com), but oftentimes don't have the time to work on every little detail. The recipes in [Cooking Light](http://www.cookinglight) are often quick but with a few tweaks, can really have some amped up flavor.

This is a collection of recipes where I try to really iterate on what is already out in the world to see if I can make it one step faster, easier, or deliciouser
